STEPS on making a Bread

1. Proof the yeast: Combine warm water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
2. Mix dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt.
3. Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.
4. Knead the dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
5. First rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.
6. Shape the dough: Punch down the dough and form it into your desired shape (loaf, rolls, etc.).
7. Second rise: Place the shaped dough on a baking sheet, cover it loosely, and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.
8. Bake: Preheat your oven to the desired temperature (typically around 350-375Â°F). Bake the bread for 30-45 minutes, or until golden brown.
9. Cool: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.
